*TLDR: My ability to change changed from 0 to 1.*

# What happened?

By the end of the summer in 2017, I was really close to graduating, yet I was so felt so far away.  I did well in the Spring semester, but I was pretty lacking in the summer.  A big thank you to Wesley for showing me his freelancing life, and for helping me with my ethics class.  I needed one more elective and to finish my incomplete project.

I did both in the fall of 2017.  In fact, I got my first A in two years!  In particular, coming home and finishing my degree in Long Island instead of College Station really gave me the right environment to awaken in September.  I really thank my parents and little brother, along with my friend T. for holding me accountable and helping me change.

I first began by fixing my sleep schedule.  Then I ate healthier, mostly greens, protein, and fruits.  I also began working out, doing squats, deadlifts and bench presses with T.  T. also introduced me to Mike Cernovich, whose book *Gorilla Mindset* and older podcasts really changed the way I approached life.  Later, Jordan Peterson gave me religion back.  Thank you.

Along the way, I held myself accountable, submitting all my projects for my Cloud Computing class without penalty.  I communicated often with Dr. Mahima, one of the instructors, in order to better coordinate my remote tests.  Most of all, I rediscovered why I fell in love with technology in the first place.  Cloud computing, software, computers, and technology is so beautiful to me, again.  For the first time in a long time, I walked away from the final feeling confident and feeling fulfilled.

I then scrambled to finish my capstone project, a web app to search and analyze other senior capstone projects.  A huge heartfelt thank you to Dr. Villareal.  By the 16th of December, I got my degree!  I spent the rest of the holidays relaxing, driving the Disney World with my family and enjoying some great food at Epcot.  And also establishing a vision for the future.
